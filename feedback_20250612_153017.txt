suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `Cat` class inherits from `Pets`, which might not be the most intuitive design.  Consider having both inherit from a common ancestor if needed (like an `Animal` class), or keeping them separate if there's no direct relationship.
- In Exercise 1, the `Siamese` class only adds an `eye_color` attribute.  The instructions suggest adding methods as well.  Consider adding methods to represent breed-specific behaviors.
- In Exercise 3, the `PetDog` class's `play` method doesn't use the `*args` effectively. It should concatenate dog names for a single output string.
- Exercise 4 is missing. The provided code only addresses exercises 1, 2, and 3.

suggestions for improvement:
- In the `Family` class, the `check_majority` method could be improved by handling the case where a person with the given `first_name` is not found in the `members` list.  Currently, it silently does nothing.  Consider adding a message indicating that the person was not found.
- Add docstrings to both the `Person` and `Family` classes and methods to improve readability and understanding.  Docstrings explain what the class/method does and parameters used.
